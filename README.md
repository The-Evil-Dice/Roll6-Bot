# Roll6-Bot
Currently uses Pircbotx 2.1, though I plan to write my own IRC connection methods to allow more freedom.
This will most likely be when the bot is a little more fully featured and more internally refined, as currently the internals are quite messy and unstructured.

Currently doing a complete rewrite of the bot using JavaFX instead of basic bitch Swing.

# Planned Features:
* Song requests with songlist command
* Switchable themes
* Optional remote customisable database to link bots (Cross channel currency and commands, for example.)
* Regex support
* Pluggable Addons
* Chat Overlay with CSS

# License
Unfortunately due to the bot currently using PircbotX to connect with IRC, the project has to be licensed under GNU GPL v3. This is a pretty restrictive license as far as open source goes, however they themselves were forced into using the license so they cannot be faulted. But, I only intend to use PircbotX for a limited time, until I make my own IRC connection API, then the restrictive licensing can be lifted.
