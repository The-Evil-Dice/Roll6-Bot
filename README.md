# Roll6-Bot
Currently uses Pircbotx 2.1, though I plan to write my own IRC connection methods to allow more freedom.
This will most likely be when the bot is a little more fully featured and more internally refined, as currently the internals are quite messy and unstructured.

Currently doing a complete rewrite of the bot using JavaFX instead of basic bitch Swing.

# Planned Features:
* Song requests with songlist command
* Switchable themes
* Optional remote customisable database to link bots (Cross channel currency and commands, for example.)
* Regex support
* Pluggable Addons
* Chat Overlay with CSS

# Libraries:  
* https://github.com/TheLQ/pircbotx - GNU GPL v3 Licensing
