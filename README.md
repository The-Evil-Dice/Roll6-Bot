# The Evil Bot
Currently uses Pircbotx 2.1, though I plan to write my own IRC connection methods to allow more freedom.
Though this will most likely be when the bot is a little more fully featured and more internally refined, as currently the internals are quite messy and unstructured.

Currently doing a complete rewrite of the bot using JavaFX instead of basic bitch Swing.
